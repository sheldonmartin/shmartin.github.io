          After looking at Shereef's fireside chat, my expectations have shifted a little for the DBC experience. I now feel like what DBC is offering, is more inline with what I want out of the experience. From the moment I decided to join DBC, I knew that I wanted to go above and beyond what the curriculum was offering. If I just did what was asked of me, then I might end up being disappointed. I like that the DBC culture values experimentation, and people who take the extra step to learn more.

            The kitchen vs restaurant mindset (a.k.a. creator vs consumer) really stood out to me. There are times when you'll come in and expect to be feed material, but at the same time you should be looking outside the box, and learning things for yourself. DBC is an organic experience, if you want the most out of it, you should help improve it. Either by creating things that weren't on the menu, or figuring out better ways of doing things that are.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a little nervous about starting DBC, but I'm also excited. I've never tried anything like the immersive learning experience being offered there, which makes me a bit nervous. But I'm excited because I really want to learn as much as possible; so I'm willing to give it my full effort.
