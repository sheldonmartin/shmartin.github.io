          Conflict is a part of everyday life. Someitmes conflict can be avoided, other times it can't. What's important is how we deal with conflict when it can't be avoided.

        <p>
          At a previous employer, I found myself in a meeting, discussing a project that indirectly involved my team. A separate team called the meeting, becasue they needed access to data that was no longer being provided, in a table they used. The table was used by a report they ran, and they needed an alternative quickly. My team happened to be the owners of that table.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the call, one of the members from the other team was very upset. This team member wanted to know why the data from the table was missing, and what was being done to fix it. My co-worker, who was looking for alternatives, brought me on to the call because I had some knowledge on the data needed for the report.
        </p>

        <p>
          While on the call, I realized that the team member was angry, and taking this call as an opportunity to critize my team and my co-worker. This team member went on and on about how my team messed up again, as if we're always doing something wrong. It started to become very obvious that this individual simply wanted to blow off steam, at the expense of others. So I started to speak to this person calmly, and gave some input and suggestions. Eventually, we discovered that the problem may have nothing to do with my team. It seemed like the issue was actually coming from somewhere further down the line, out of my team's control. It was then decided that more investigation should be done, and we'd dicsuss the matter at a later date.
        </p>

        <p>
          This particular conflict ended well, but could have gone horribly wrong. At the time I was starting to feel upset, because my co-worker and my team were being critized unfairly. At the start of the call, no one really knew what the issue was, but many were ready to point fingers. We were being blamed because it was eaiser than finding out the truth. I'm glad I stayed calm and professional. Had I become upset like others, it could have turned into a heated argument, and made matters worse.
