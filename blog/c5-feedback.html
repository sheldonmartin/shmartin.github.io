        <h2>My experience with pair programming and providing feedback</h2>

          <h4>Pairing</h4>
          <p>
            Pairing with other people has been pretty interesting. I realized that it was more difficult to pair program than I thought. For the most part, I didn’t have trouble following along with someone else’s train of thought, but there were times when it became pretty difficult. These were the times when someone else had an idea that was very different from mine. There was one instance where I didn’t fully understand my pair’s solution for the challenge, until most of it had been written.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most rewarding part of pairing, was meeting new people and finding out how they think. On some of the easier challenges, my ideas and my pair’s ideas for the solution were pretty similar. But on the more difficult ones, our way of thinking would diverge, giving me a new perspective. I ended up picking up tips and tricks that I wouldn’t have thought of myself.
          </p>

          <h4>Feedback</h4>
          <p>
            I felt pretty good about the feedback I received. It was mostly positive and that made me feel like I’m moving on the right track. However, I did get some constructive feedback that I plan to address going forward. One of which was thinking out loud during pairing sessions. I managed to do this well on some pairing sessions but not others. That usually happened with the more difficult exercises. It was harder for me to be verbal with my thought process, since I’m use to working alone. It didn’t surprise me that this was mentioned in my feedback, but it gave me confirmation since other picked up on it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Writing constructive feedback was more difficult than I thought it would be. I wanted to make sure what I wrote would be helpful to my pair, and highlighted areas that they should work on. But that can sometimes seem negative and I didn't want to offend anyone. So I did my best to make sure the tone stayed positive, and could be viewed as helpful, not criticizing.
