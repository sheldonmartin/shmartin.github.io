        <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

            Like most people, I've always been aware of stereotypes, but haven't thought much about how stereotype threat has affected my behavior. I'd like to think it hasn't, since I'm the type of person who tries not to be held back by stereotypes. When I'm working on something that's important to me, I put in my full effort. Whether people like me are considered good at the particular task, is not my first concern. However, it is something I think about. If it's negative, I see it as something to disprove, rather than     confirm.

            What concerns me are the times when I'm not consciously thinking about it. When it's in the back of my head affecting my actions without me knowing. I remember when I was in college, I got help correcting a paper from a member of the writing center on campus. The woman who was helping me suggested I use a particular word in one of my sentences. I don't remember which word it was, but I responded by telling her it wasn't a word I would normally use. She asked me why not, and if I knew what the word meant. I did, and I told her what it meant. In the end, I agreed to use the word in my sentence, but the whole thing bothered me. I purposely choose not to use my full vocabulary, simply because it didn't sound like me. At the time I probably believed that. But when I think about it, the issue wasn't that it didn't sound like me specifically, it just didn't sound like people like me.

            There I was, imposing limits on myself. Something I consciously told myself not to do. If I saw someone else in a similar situation, I would have probably given advice similar to what the woman from the writing center gave me. When I see others restricting themselves due to stereotypes, I encourage them to break free. But at that time, I didn't follow my own advice. It wasn't until later, when I made friends in college who were like me, and didn't impose the same limit on themselves, that I realized how foolish I was being.
