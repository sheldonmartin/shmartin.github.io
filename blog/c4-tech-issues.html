        <h4 class="sub-title">The Problem</h4>
        <p>
          One of the biggest problems in the tech world, is what becomes of old technology. Like many things you stop using, old phones, computers, and toys, get thrown away and end up becoming e-waste. A lot of this garbage ends up being taken and dumped in other countires, under false pretences of being used goods. Companies that are supposed to recyle used or broken technology, don't becasue it's expensive and simply cheaper to just through it away. They end up in landfills that polute the environemnt becase of the toxic materials in these products.

          Our need to stay up to date with technology, is one of the biggest reasons e-waste is becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Take the cell phone for instance. We upgrade to a new cell phone every two years now. Some phones don't even last much longer than that, since manufacturers know they are selling to customers who will get rid of the phone around the 2 year mark. Some of the newer cell phone plans have customers getting a new phone very year.

        <h4 class="sub-title">The Solution?</h4>
        <p>
          It's a complex problem, but there are some simple things that can be done to reduce the amount of waste being produced. Average people, like you and me, can hold on to our tech for a few more years than we usually do. We can also make sure that once we do decide to discard our used technolgoy, it's donated to be reused or recycled properly.
