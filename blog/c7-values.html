          	This week's blog post is about affirming your values to combat stereotype threat. One value that is very important to me is accomplishment. Right now it's one of the main drivers in my life. It's the reason I'm in DBC, and why I want to become a web developer. When I was in college, I took a web development class in my senior year. The entire class was focused around a single project, we'd work on it from the beginning of the class, to the end. Working on that assignment was one of the most difficult things I had to do in my college career, it was also the single most rewarding thing. The sense of accomplishment I felt when I completed the project was amazing. I never ended up getting into web development after college, but I knew I wanted to. I knew it would be a career that I'd enjoy, and give me a great feeling of accomplishment.

            The last topic someone asked me for advice on, was which programming language to learn first. I've personally looked in to this many times, so I have a lot of knowledge on the subject. I told my friend, the language was less important than what he wanted to do. You should decide what kind of programs you want to make make first, be it desktop, web, or mobile applications. Once you've figured that out, then you should pick a language that's right for the task. Knowledge is one of the values I find most important. Because of my knowledge in the subject, I was able to help him with his decision.

          	I feel very motivated when I think about my values. I enjoy learning new things, it gives me a sense of accomplishment. I believe that focusing on my values, will leave no room for stereotype threat. If I find myself down for any reason while at DBC, I know that I need to redirect my attention. Either by taking a break or focusing on my work. As I learn more, I'll be more confident in my work, and have a brighter outlook on what's to come after DBC.
