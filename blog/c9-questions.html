          <h4>Where my search begins</h4>
          <p>
            I've frequently visited sites like Stack Overflow to find answers to technical questions, but I've never asked them directly. I google everything. I pretty much expect google to find the answers to all my questions. Google is how I found out about technical Q&A sites in the first place. I google my question, and usually get back either a blog post, or a link to a Q&A site. Going forward, I'm going to start using the Q&A sites directly, here's why:

          <h4>Smaller vs Larger Goals</h4>
          <p>
            When I ask a technical question, it's always been for the smaller goals. I usually have a general idea of how I want to solve a given problem, but I get stuck on one of the intermediate steps. This smaller goal, is a good candidate for a google search, since the question is usually fairly short. For example, if I was trying reverse the letters in a word using ruby, I'd first try to separate each letter in the word into an array. From there I'd reverse the array, then join the letters back again. But what if I didn't know about Array#join or Array#reverse. I might simply ask how to reverse elements in an array, and then come up with my own way of joining array elements. The solution would look something like this:

          <p>
            What I don't think about, is asking about the larger goal first. There may be a better way of doing what I need done. But I only ever ask about the smaller goals, I always try to figure out the larger goal on my own. Using the previous example, if I asked for a solution to my overall problem, I probably would have gotten a more concise suggestion like this:
          </p>

          <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/shmartin/fe448563fd8106e50ec7.js"></script></p>
          
          <h4>Focused Searches</h4>
          <p>
            The example I provided isn't exactly complicated, but I think using a Q&A site directly, would be a better way to find answers for this type of question. The longer or more complex the question, the harder it is to google. This probably holds true for searching for answers to questions online in general, but Q&A sites are better equipped to handle them. Some sites allow users to add tags to their questions, making it easier for people searching for questions to filter out their results. Going to a Q&A site that focuses on technical questions, should generally provide higher quality answers, since the audience is technology focused. A general google search might get hits from a more general Q&A site, which may not have the same quality answers as a technical site.
          </p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Going forward, I'll definitely start searching for answers on technical Q&A sites. I realize I've been taking a very indirect route for researching my technical questions. I've also never posted a question online. I always assume that someone else has already asked my question, and I simply need to look harder to find it. This is probably true most of the time, but there are definitely times when I should have posted my own question.
