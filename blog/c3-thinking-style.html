          So according to the Gregorc Thinking Style model, I'm an abstract sequential (AS) thinker. The funny thing is that when I took the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style</a> quiz, it marked me as 28 in almost all the categories, except for AS. For AS I got a 36, which is the difference of only 2 questions. I thought maybe I should retake the test, to see if I could get a more definitive answer. Then I researched AS, and found a lot of its traits to be pretty acurate as to how I think.

        <p>
          Since I now understand my thinking style, I plan to use it to help me learn more at DBC. For instance, AS thinkers like to analyze situations before making a decision or acting. They also like to apply logic in solving problems. These are things I do at work and in my personal life. I plan to incorporate them into my work at DBC, via pseudocoding and wireframing. I believe getting better at these two things, will help me to learn more while at DBC.

        <p>
          I also plan on putting aside some time to work alone while at DBC. Pair programming is a great aspect of DBC, and I think getting better at it will help me greatly in my professional career. However, I've had a hard time thinking clearly while in my pair programming sessions. I've come to realize that I have an easier time working alone, which is common for AS thinkers. Instead of completely disregarding that, and focusing on pair programming, I plan on spliting my time between the two. I believe that researching and practicing new concepts alone, will help me solidify what I learn during my pairing sessions.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to become more well-rounded, I plan on addressing the weaknesses of the AS thinking style that apply to me. Since pair programming is such a big part of DBC, I'll have plenty of opportunity to get better at learning while working with others. Another weakness of the AS learning style, is having too little time to deal with a subject throughly. Personally, I tend to over research new subjects. So having a short amount of time to learn a new concept or idea, might be difficult for me. Working more on my time management will help with this and other aspects.
