          Creating my own personal website, has been a pretty interesting experience. Right now there isn't much content, it's mostly about my blog. In the future, I hope to fill the projects page with work I've done or am involved in.

          Blogging has been a love-hate sort of thing. I've never felt comfortable talking about myself publicly online. I'm also not that active on social media. But blogging has definitely made me more open when it comes to both those things. Some of the post I've worked on were easy for me to write. I either had some knowledge of the subject or I found it really interesting. Those are usually the ones people from DBC enjoyed reading. But I learned the most from the ones that weren't so easy to write. Those post took me out of my comfort zone, and forced me to learn new things, or talk about things I wasn't too comfortable sharing.

          The hardest part about creating my own website, was designing it. I had a lot of trouble coming up with a design I liked. The design I have now, was a slow progression from the original. I'm not exactly in love with it, but I think it's pretty good for now. As time goes on, I plan to update my design and add more content.
