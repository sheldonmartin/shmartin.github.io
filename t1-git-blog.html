    <h4>Version Control</h4>
    <p>
      Have you ever needed to undo a change that you made to a file, but you can't remember exactly what the changes were, or when you made them? If so, then you'd probably benefit from version control. A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to save a file in different states over time. If you make a mistake in a file and need to undo the changes, you can go back to a previous version of the file using a VCS. You store your files in what's called a repository. It's pretty much a folder that you keep your files in, and it may contain subfolders to help organize your files.
    </p>

    <h4>What is Git?</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a type of distributed VCS (meaning users have local copies of the repositories they work in) that lets you collaborate with other people, while working on the same project or even the same file, at the same time. The main repository is kept in a central location, so everyone can access it. When someone want to start working on a repository, they create a copy of it on their local computer. There they can make changes to any file that they want. Once they are done, they can commit their changes, which creates a copy of those changes. They can then push those changes back to the main repository, merging their changes into the files there. Git keeps track of individual changes made. So when someone merges their changes into the main repository, they don't overwrite the changes made by someone else.

    <h4>What is GitHub?</h4>
    <p>
      GitHub is a social media website that allows people to share their code using Git repositories. It lets you easily set up repositories and share them with others online. People using GitHub can copy your code or your repositories (if they are public), and create updates for themselves or for you to incorporate into your own code. GitHub is a great way to share code or find others to help you work on a project.
