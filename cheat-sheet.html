        <p>
          Ruby integers are whole numbers, like 1, 2, and 3. They work with the common arithmetic operators for addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), and multiplication (*). There is also one more operator called modulo (%), which returns the remainder between two values. Below is an example of how to use integers with arithmetic operators.

        <p>
          A String object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing characters. String objects may be created using String::new or as literals.

        <h2>Arrays</h2>
      </div>      
      <section>
        <p>
          Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java. A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on. A new array can be created by using the literal constructor []. Arrays can contain different types of objects. For example, the array below contains an Integer, a String and a Float:

        <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/achen116/b1be0e063446202973f8.js"></script></p>
        <p>
          Elements in an array can be retrieved using the #[] method. It can take a single integer argument (a numeric index), a pair of arguments (start and length) or a range. Negative indices start counting from the end, with -1 being the last element.

        <p>
          See below for some examples of common array methods.

        <h2>Hashes</h2>
      </div>
      <section>
        <p>
          A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.
            Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
